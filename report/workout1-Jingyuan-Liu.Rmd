## Introduction
Tropical cyclone is an atmospheric phenomenon that attract widespread interests not only in the scientific field but also in the public due to its server damage to human beings. IBTrACs project of NOAA manages a centralized archive of tropical cyclone data to facilitate our understanding of the distribution and evolution of storms. In this project, cyclones data from year 2010 to 2015 were download from the IBTrACs project website. Twelve variables of cyclone data were extracted from the CSV files and combined into one CSV file for exploratory analysis in this project.

The analysis in this project proceeds in three steps. As the combined CSV data contains missing or NA values, data cleaning will be first described. The statistical information about the variables in the spatial and temporal dimensions will then be explored aiming at obtaining a general understanding of the variables in the data. To be specific, the spatial distribution of cyclones and its temporal variation from year 2010 to 2015 are explored and discussed.

## Data cleaning
The code bellow imports the combined CSV file. Names for 12 variables are recoded and the missing values represented by -999, -1, 0 are converted to NA. All records with NA values are discarded for the following analysis.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
ibt <- read_csv("../data/ibtracs-2010-2015.csv", na = c(""),
                col_types = list(col_character(), col_integer(), col_character(),
                                 col_factor(), col_character(), col_character(), 
                                 col_character(), col_character(), col_double(), 
                                 col_double(), col_double(), col_double()))
names(ibt) <- c("serial_num", "season", "num", "basin", "sub_basin", "name", 
                "iso_time", "nature", "latitude", "longitude", "wind", "press")
# convert missing values to NA
ibt <-ibt %>%
  mutate(latitude = na_if(latitude, "-999")) %>%
  mutate(longitude = na_if(longitude, "-999")) %>%
  mutate(wind = na_if(wind, "-1")) %>%
  mutate(wind = na_if(wind, "-999")) %>%
  mutate(wind = na_if(wind, "0")) %>%
  mutate(press = na_if(press, "-1")) %>%
  mutate(press = na_if(press, "-999")) %>%
  mutate(press = na_if(press, "0"))
ibt <- na.omit(ibt)
```

## Temporal variation of storms
Basic statistics can be used to acquire some interesting information about the cyclones. The code below output the number of storms occurred in each year. The results show that over 90 storms occurred in 2013 and 2015. The number of storms occurred can also be explored on monthly scale. The code below computes the numbers of storms occurred over the months of a year. The results show that storms do not occurred uniformly throughout the year. Months 8, 9, 10 have seen more storm activity, especially September experienced the highest number of storms over a year.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# number of (unique) storms in each year
ibt %>%
  group_by(season) %>%
  distinct(serial_num) %>%
  count()
# by month
ibt$month <- month(as_date(ibt$iso_time))
ibt %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  distinct(serial_num) %>%
  count()
```

More direct way to show the variation on storm activity is mapping the trajectories of the storms occurred at different time periods The two figures below offer the variation of trajectories over the Eastern Pacific and Northern Atlantic at different time scales. The similar patterns can be seen from the map that number storms tend to be uniform in years but highly variable in months over a year.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/map-ep-na-storms-by-year.png")
```
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/map-ep-na-storms-by-month.png")
```

The duration of storms was computed from the code bellow. The statistics of the duration of all storms shows that the maximum duration of the storms is about 24 days and the average duration of the storms is nearly 8 days.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
ibt$date <- lubridate::as_date(ibt$iso_time)
ans <- ibt %>%
  group_by(serial_num) %>%
  mutate(dur = as.numeric(max(date) - min(date), units = "days"))
summary(ans$dur)
ggplot(data = ans) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = dur), bins = 20) +
  xlab("Days") + ylab("Frequency") + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of storms duration") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) 
```

The wind speed and pressure data were also been recorded for each storm. The storms with the highest wind speed can be identified by the code below. According to the histogram, most storms lasted around 8 day, only a few storms deviated heavily from the typical duration of storms. The code below output the storms with its maximum speed in descending order.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
ibt %>%
  select(serial_num, wind) %>%
  group_by(serial_num) %>%
  mutate(max_speed = max(wind)) %>%
  select(serial_num, max_speed) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  arrange(desc(max_speed))
```


# Spatial variation of storms
Storms activity variation at different regions on Earth can be explored from different scales. First, the differences of storms activity in the two hemisphere is discussed by computing total number of storms occurred per hemisphere during the years 2010-2015. The number of storms in the north hemisphere is nearly triple of the number in southern hemisphere. Therefore, it can be observed that the north hemisphere is the region that suffers the storms more severely.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# total number of storms per hemisphere
ibt %>%
  group_by(latitude >= 0) %>%
  distinct(serial_num) %>%
  count()
```

To determine the variation of storm activity at different basin regions, numbers of storms occurred in different basins over the years are summarized by the following code. According to the output, Western Pacific suffered storms most frequently but the Southern Atlantic region rarely experienced storms. Southern Indian, Eastern Pacific and North Atlantic also experienced heavily storm activity.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
ibt %>%
  group_by(basin) %>%
  distinct(serial_num) %>%
  count()
```

The previous discussion of the spatial variation of storm activity can be clearly seen from the trajectories on a map. The map provided below shows all the trajectories of storms occurred during 2010-2015. From the map, it can be seen that northern hemisphere and regions around the Atlantic sea and Pacific sea experienced most storms. And a high spatial variation of storm activity can be confirmed

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/map-all-storms.png")
```


## Conclusion
Data processing and analysis in R has been practiced in this project. The tropical cyclone data from 2010 to 2015 was used to explore the basic statistical information of the storm variables. The storm activity at different time scales and locations were explored. A high variation of storm activity is revealed from the analysis.
